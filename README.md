### Compress your files!

When adding files, using the `pdfshrink.py' script to compress them.

The script is made to be run on Linux, and it requires Python 3.5+.

Usage: `pdfshrink.py [path]`

The optional `path` parameter can be:
- The path to the pdf file to compress.
- The path to a folder to search pdf files in.
If omitted, the script will search for pdfs in the current folder and its sub-folders.
